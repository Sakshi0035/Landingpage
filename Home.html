    <h1>
      Hi there, It's nice to meet you!
    </h1>
    <p>
      I am a student at <a href="https://www.orchidengg.ac.in/" target="_blank">N.K.Orchid College of Engineering and Technology</a> pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. And this is my mini project Landing page Website. I am making this Website to gain some Knowledge about HTML and CSS code in Web Technology by coding it all by myself. This is my first time to Write a code all by myself. I am excited to learn more about this. And its not like that i had not taken any refference, actually I had but just only the code where I'm stuck.
    </p>

      I think this is the best way to learn about HTML and CSS. Because when we do it by working or doing it practically, it is very easy to understand.
